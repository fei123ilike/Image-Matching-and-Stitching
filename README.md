# Image-Matching-and-Stitching
##Introduction
Interest point detectors and descriptors are at the heart of most computer vision applications. The goal of this practice is to gain insights by working on one such application in determining homographies. This project shows how to transform between template images and source images, as is commonly used in panoramic photo stitching and augmented reality applications.
